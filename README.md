# Landing_webpage
Programmed a landing page for a website to practice and improve designing skill with css. Used a sample design provided by The Odin Project to create the website. While the design was provided, the code was all original and the images and wording used as well. To acces the website click on the link provided in the 'About' section of the repository to view the webpage. 

**Notice ~ The webpage layout will display correctly on all computers and tablets but may have an issue if you open it on a mobile device. If it does not display properly on mobile, flip the device sideways to landscape mode to display correctly.
